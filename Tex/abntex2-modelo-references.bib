abstract = {A cocktail party. A terrorist cell. Ancient bacteria. An international conglomerate. All are networks, and all are a part of a surprising scientific revolution. Albert-L{\&}aacuteszl{\&}oacute Barab{\&}aacutesi, the nation's foremost expert in the new science of networks, takes us on an intellectual adventure to prove that social networks, corporations, and living organisms are more similar than previously thought. Grasping a full understanding of network science will someday allow us to design blue-chip businesses, stop the outbreak of deadly diseases, and influence the exchange of ideas and information. Just as James Gleick brought the discovery of chaos theory to the general public, Linked tells the story of the true science of the future.},

%Network medicine
@article{Barabasi2011,
abstract = {Given the functional interdependencies between the molecular components in a human cell, a disease is rarely a consequence of an abnormality in a single gene, but reflects the perturbations of the complex intracellular and intercellular network that links tissue and organ systems. The emerging tools of network medicine offer a platform to explore systematically not only the molecular complexity of a particular disease, leading to the identification of disease modules and pathways, but also the molecular relationships among apparently distinct (patho)phenotypes. Advances in this direction are essential for identifying new disease genes, for uncovering the biological significance of disease-associated mutations identified by genome-wide association studies and full-genome sequencing, and for identifying drug targets and biomarkers for complex diseases.},

%Pavlopous
@article{Pavlopoulos2011,
abstract = {Understanding complex systems often requires a bottom-up analysis towards a systems biology approach. The need to investigate a system, not only as individual components but as a whole, emerges. This can be done by examining the elementary constituents individually and then how these are connected. The myriad components of a system and their interactions are best characterized as networks and they are mainly represented as graphs where thousands of nodes are connected with thousands of vertices. In this article we demonstrate approaches, models and methods from the graph theory universe and we discuss ways in which they can be used to reveal hidden properties and features of a network. This network profiling combined with knowledge extraction will help us to better understand the biological significance of the system.},

%Relative importance
@article{White2003,
abstract = {Large and complex graphs representing relationships among sets of entities are an increasingly common focus of inter- est in data analysis—examples include social networks,Web graphs, telecommunication networks, and biological networks. In interactive analysis of such data a natural query is “which entities are most important in the network relative to a par- ticular individual or set of individuals?” We investigate the problem of answering such queries in this paper, focusing in particular on defining and computing the importance of nodes in a graph relative to one or more root nodes. We define a general framework and a number of different algo- rithms, building on ideas from social networks, graph theory, Markov models, and Web graph analysis. We experimen- tally evaluate the different properties of these algorithms on toy graphs and demonstrate how our approach can be used to study relative importance in real-world networks including a network of interactions among September 11th terrorists, a network of collaborative research in biotech- nology among companies and universities, and a network of co-authorship relationships among computer science re- searchers.},

%Human Disease Network
@article{Goh2012,
abstract = {Advances in genome-scale molecular biology and molecular genetics have greatly elevated our knowledge on the basic components of human biology and diseases. At the same time, the importance of cellular networks between those biological components is increasingly appreciated. Built upon these recent technological and conceptual advances, a new discipline called the network medicine, an approach to understand human diseases from a network point-of-view, is about to emerge. In this review article, we will survey some recent endeavours along this direction, centred on the concept and applications of the human diseasome and the human disease network. Questions, and partial answers thereof, such as how the connectivity between molecular parts translates into the relationships between the related disorders on a global scale and how central the disease-causing genetic components are in the cellular network, will be discussed. The use of the diseasome in combination with various interactome networks and other disease-related factors is also reviewed.},

%Bridging
@article{Hwang2006,
abstract = {Several centrality measures were introduced to identify essential components and compute components{\{}{\^{a}}{\}} importance in networks. Majority of these centrality measures are dominated by components{\{}{\^{a}}{\}} degree due to their nature of looking at networks{\{}{\^{a}}{\}} topology. We propose a novel essential component identification model, bridging centrality, based on information flow and topological locality in scale-free networks. Bridging centrality provides an entirely new way of scrutinizing network structures and measuring components{\{}{\^{a}}{\}} importance. We apply bridging centrality on real world networks, including one simulated network, two biological networks, two social networks, and one web network, and show that the nodes distinguished by bridging centrality are well located on the connecting positions between highly connected regions through analyzing the clustering coefficient and average path length of those networks. Bridging centrality can discriminate bridging nodes, the nodes with more information flowed through them and locations between highly connected regions, while other centrality measures can not. },

The most basic issues are structural: how does one characterize the wiring diagram of a food web or the Internet or the metabolic network of the bacterium Escherichia coli? Are there any unifying principles underlying their topology? From the perspective of nonlinear dynamics, we would also like to understand how an enormous network of interacting dynamical systems-be they neurons, power stations or lasers-will behave collectively, given their individual dynamics and coupling architecture. Researchers are only now beginning to unravel the structure and dynamics of complex networks.},

%Coexpressão de transcritos
@article{Gaiteri2014,
abstract = {In a research environment dominated by reductionist approaches to brain disease mechanisms, gene network analysis provides a complementary framework in which to tackle the complex dysregulations that occur in neuropsychiatric and other neurological disorders. Gene-gene expression correlations are a common source of molecular networks because they can be extracted from high-dimensional disease data and encapsulate the activity of multiple regulatory systems. However, the analysis of gene coexpression patterns is often treated as a mechanistic black box, in which looming 'hub genes' direct cellular networks, and where other features are obscured. By examining the biophysical bases of coexpression and gene regulatory changes that occur in disease, recent studies suggest it is possible to use coexpression networks as a multi-omic screening procedure to generate novel hypotheses for disease mechanisms. Because technical processing steps can affect the outcome and interpretation of coexpression networks, we examine the assumptions and alternatives to common patterns of coexpression analysis and discuss additional topics such as acceptable datasets for coexpression analysis, the robust identification of modules, disease-related prioritization of genes and molecular systems and network meta-analysis. To accelerate coexpression research beyond modules and hubs, we highlight some emerging directions for coexpression network research that are especially relevant to complex brain disease, including the centrality-lethality relationship, integration with machine learning approaches and network pharmacology.},

%============================= ROBUSTNESS ==============================

@article{Mudry2011,
abstract = {During the last 20 years, bone-anchored hearing aids (Baha({\textregistered})) became a familiar solution in the treatment of some types of hearing loss. The aim of this chapter is to present the different historical steps which have permitted the production of this new bone conduction hearing device. The recognition of bone conduction hearing is old and was known at least in Antiquity. During the Renaissance, Girolamo Cardano demonstrated a method by which sound may be transmitted to the ear by means of a rod or the shaft of a spear held between one's teeth: this was the beginning of teeth stimulators to improve hearing, firstly in connection with a musical instrument and then, in the second part of the 19th century, with the speaker. The development of the carbon microphone at the beginning of the 20th century allowed the construction of the bone conduction vibrator placed on the mastoid area, notably supported by eyeglasses since the 1950s. Confronted by various problems, and notably the loss of part of sound in the soft tissue of the external mastoid, the idea to implant the vibrator into the mastoid bone was developed in G{\"{o}}teborg, and the first Baha was implanted in 1977 by Anders Tjellstr{\"{o}}m. From that date, various improvements allowed the development of the actual Baha. These different steps are presented in this study, supported by original documentation.},

%Ciencias genomicas LIVRO
@book{Fallis2013,
abstract = {Predicting the binding mode of flexible polypeptides to proteins is an important task that falls outside the domain of applicability of most small molecule and protein−protein docking tools. Here, we test the small molecule flexible ligand docking program Glide on a set of 19 non-$\alpha$-helical peptides and systematically improve pose prediction accuracy by enhancing Glide sampling for flexible polypeptides. In addition, scoring of the poses was improved by post-processing with physics-based implicit solvent MM- GBSA calculations. Using the best RMSD among the top 10 scoring poses as a metric, the success rate (RMSD ≤ 2.0 {\AA} for the interface backbone atoms) increased from 21{\%} with default Glide SP settings to 58{\%} with the enhanced peptide sampling and scoring protocol in the case of redocking to the native protein structure. This approaches the accuracy of the recently developed Rosetta FlexPepDock method (63{\%} success for these 19 peptides) while being over 100 times faster. Cross-docking was performed for a subset of cases where an unbound receptor structure was available, and in that case, 40{\%} of peptides were docked successfully. We analyze the results and find that the optimized polypeptide protocol is most accurate for extended peptides of limited size and number of formal charges, defining a domain of applicability for this approach.},
